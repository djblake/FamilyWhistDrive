## Family Statistics Integration

### Tournament Engine Integration
```javascript
// Set up family tree with tournament data
familyTree.setTournamentEngine(tournamentEngine);

// Get family statistics
const familyStats = familyTree.calculateFamilyStatistics('ruston');

// Family performance breakdown
{
  family_name: "Ruston",
  total_members: 8,
  active_members: 6,
  tournament_wins: 12,
  total_tournaments: 40,
  average_tricks: 6.7,
  win_percentage: 30.0,
  family_champions: [...],
  top_performers: [...]
}
```

### Statistical Calculations
- **Aggregate totals**: Sum of all family member performance
- **Family averages**: Performance metrics across all members
- **Championship tracking**: Tournament wins by family members
- **Multi-generational analysis**: Performance by generation
- **Cross-family comparisons**: Rivalry statistics and head-to-head

// Show top family performers
rustonStats.top_performers.forEach(player => {
  console.log(`${player.name}: ${player.wins} wins, ${player.average} avg`);
});
```

### Rivalry Analysis
```javascript
// Analyze Ruston vs Wilson rivalry
const rivalry = familyTree.calculateRivalryStatistics('ruston', 'wilson');
console.log(`Current streak: ${rivalry.head_to_head.current_streak.family} 
             (${rivalry.head_to_head.current_streak.count} wins)`);
```

### Family Tree Navigation
```javascript
// Get player's complete family context
const lineage = familyTree.getFamilyLineage('margaret_wilson');
console.log(`Parents: ${lineage.parents.map(p => p.name).join(', ')}`);
console.log(`Children: ${lineage.children.map(c => c.name).join(', ')}`);
